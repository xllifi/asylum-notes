A font originally intended as a parody of street writings (namely russian "продам гараж") but turned out looking more like it was written by a mentally unstable person.

## Usage
⚠️ This resourcepack doesn't replace anything!
You'll have to specify a font. This can be done with formatting, namely [Raw JSON (Vanilla)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Raw_JSON_text_format#Java_Edition) `{"text": "Text", "font": "asylumnotes"}` or [MiniMessage (Recommended)](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html#font) `<font:asylumnotes>Text</font>`.
